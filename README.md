A README is a text file (usually named README.md) that appears on the main page of a GitHub repository.
Its purpose is to explain the project to anyone who visits the repo.

⭐ Why is a README important?

Because it helps people understand:

What the project is about

How to install and use it

What technologies it uses

Who created it

How others can contribute

Without a README, the repo looks incomplete and confusing.

📄 Why is it called README.md?

README → means “Read Me”, telling the user that this file contains important info.

.md → means “Markdown”, a simple language used to format text (headings, lists, code blocks, etc.).

GitHub automatically formats Markdown nicely.
